# Phase_II_Requisitions

Archive of Phase II module assembly (Both ETL and TFPX) requisitions and quotes.

To help keep this archive organized, please use the following filename format: `YYYY_MM_{VENDOR}{DESC}.(pdf|xls)`

If you need to make an order consisting of many different items, consider listing them in a yaml file (see examples in the `yml/` folder). Then you can use the `yml2xls.py` tool to convert them into a set of xls or pdf files.
